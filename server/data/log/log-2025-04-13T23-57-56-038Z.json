I remember from the history that they're working on a chat application using Node.js. They were getting messages saved in a log file, but the frontend wasn't behaving correctly.\n\nI should respond in a friendly and helpful manner. Since they're asking \"oi?\", maybe they're checking if I'm here to help. I should acknowledge their greeting and offer assistance. I'll keep it simple and open-ended so they feel comfortable asking for what they need.\n\nI should also consider that they might not speak perfect Portuguese, so keeping the response clear and straightforward is important. Maybe they need help fixing the frontend issue, so I'll make sure to let them know I'm here to help with that or anything else they need.\n</think>\n\nOlá! Como posso ajudá-lo hoje?"
