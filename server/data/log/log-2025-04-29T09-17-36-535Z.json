Now they're greeting again, maybe they're starting the conversation.\n\nI should acknowledge their greeting again but perhaps prompt them to ask a question or specify their needs. Since the previous response was in Portuguese, I'll keep it consistent. Maybe say something like \"Ol√°! Parece que voc√™ quer come√ßar uma conversa t√©cnica. Em que posso ajudar hoje?\" to encourage them to state their problem or question. \n\nI need to make sure it's friendly but focused on moving the conversation forward. Let's avoid repeating the same message. Maybe add a hint about the technical areas I can assist with, like previous mention of Node.js, Express, etc. But keep it concise. Alright, that should work.\n\n\nOl√°! Parece que voc√™ quer come√ßar uma conversa t√©cnica. Em que posso ajudar hoje? Se tiver algum desafio em programa√ß√£o, arquitetura de sistemas ou integra√ß√£o com tecnologias modernas, estou √† disposi√ß√£o. üòä"
