Let me check the previous interactions.\n\nIn the history, the user had said \"oi\" before, and I responded with a friendly offer to help. Now they added another \"ola\", so maybe they're being informal. I should acknowledge their greeting again but prompt them to get into the technical discussion. \n\nI need to stay on point with the system's instructions‚Äîkeep it technical and focused. Since there's no new context yet, I should encourage them to state their problem or question. Maybe say something like \"Ol√°! Parece que voc√™ est√° entrando em um novo t√≥pico. Em que √°rea preciso auxili√°-lo hoje?\" to steer towards their needs. \n\nAlso, remind them of the technical areas I can help with, like programming, architecture, etc. Keep it friendly but professional. Avoid repeating the same response as before. Make sure it's in Portuguese and follows the guidelines. Alright, that should work.\n\n\nOl√°! Parece que voc√™ est√° entrando em um novo t√≥pico. Em que √°rea preciso auxili√°-lo hoje? Seja em **codifica√ß√£o pr√°tica**, **arquitetura de sistemas**, **debugging**, **otimiza√ß√£o de c√≥digo** ou qualquer desafio t√©cnico, estou √† disposi√ß√£o. üòä"
