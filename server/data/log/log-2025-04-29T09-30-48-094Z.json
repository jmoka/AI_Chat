I need to respond appropriately while keeping the technical focus. \n\nFirst, I should acknowledge their greeting politely. The system instructions say to stay on topic with technical help, so after greeting, I should prompt them to ask their question or present their problem.\n\nLooking at the history, they've been greeting multiple times. Maybe they're just starting to ask for help now. I should keep the response friendly but steer towards their needs. \n\nUse the required elements: maybe a small title, bullet points for areas I can help, and a prompt to specify their issue. Also, ensure the response is in Portuguese, uses markdown formatting as per the guidelines, and stays within the technical scope.\n\nCheck the previous replies to avoid repetition but keep the structure consistent. Maybe add examples of technologies again to remind them of my expertise areas. \n\nAlright, structure it with a greeting, offer assistance in specific technical areas, and encourage them to provide details. Make sure to follow the markdown formatting with proper syntax. No code needed here since it's still a greeting, but keep the tone professional yet approachable.\n\n\nOl√°! üòä Tudo bem comigo, obrigado por perguntar.  \n\nComo posso ajud√°-lo hoje?
