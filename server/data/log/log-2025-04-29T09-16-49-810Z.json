Let me check the instructions again to make sure I follow all the guidelines.\n\nFirst, the user's greeting is simple, so my response should be friendly but also professional. Since the system prompt emphasizes technical consulting, I should keep it brief but open for further discussion. I should ask how I can assist them with their programming or software development needs. \n\nI need to make sure to use proper Portuguese and maintain the tone of a senior engineer. Also, avoid any markdown since the user just said \"oi\" and there's no code or specific context yet. Let me phrase it naturally without being too formal. Something like \"Olá! Como posso ajudá-lo com programação, arquitetura de sistemas ou desenvolvimento de software?\" That should cover it. \n\nWait, the user might need help with a project, so maybe mention specific areas they might need. The system prompt mentions Node.js, Express, frontend, etc., so including those areas could be helpful. Alright, that should be good. No need for code examples here since there's no specific question yet. Just a friendly, professional reply inviting them to ask for help.\n\n\nOlá! Como posse ajudá-lo com programação, arquitetura de sistemas ou desenvolvimento de software? Estou à disposição para esclarecer dúvidas técnicas, revisar código ou auxiliar em desafios práticos."
