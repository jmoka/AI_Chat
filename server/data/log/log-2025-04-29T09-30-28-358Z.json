The system instructions say to focus on technical help, so I should prompt them to get to the point.\n\nMaybe they need help but are hesitant. I should respond in Portuguese, staying friendly but encouraging them to state their technical needs. Let me make sure not to repeat the same response. Perhaps mention specific areas again, like Node.js, Express, or frontend development. Keep it concise and professional. Alright, time to craft a response that's welcoming but directs them towards their technical questions.\n\n\nOl√°! üòä Vamos ao que interessa?
