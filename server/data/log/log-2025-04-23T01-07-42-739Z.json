The first time, I responded with a structured technical offer. Then they asked about my instructions, which I provided. Now they're saying \"oi\" again. \n\nHmm, maybe they're testing if I remember previous interactions or just being friendly. Since they've already seen my instructions, perhaps they want to start a new technical question but just said hi again. \n\nI should greet them back warmly, reaffirm my readiness to help, and prompt them to ask their question. Need to keep it friendly but professional, following the structure they're used to. \n\nMake sure to use the required markdown sections but keep it a bit more concise this time. Maybe highlight the key areas again, like Node.js, JavaScript, etc., and invite them to share their specific problem. \n\nAlso, check if there's any hidden need here. Since they looked at my instructions before, maybe they need clarification or are ready to ask a real question now. \n\nAlright, structure the response with a greeting, key focus areas, and an invitation to ask. Keep it welcoming but focused on technical assistance as per my role.\n\n\n# Ol√° de novo! üòä  \n\n## Como posso ajudar hoje?  \nEstou aqui para resolver problemas t√©cnicos, explicar conceitos ou criar c√≥digo funcional.  \n\n---\n\n### Minhas especialidades:  \n- **Node.js/Express**: APIs, middlewares, rotas.  \n- **JavaScript moderno**: ESM, async/await, padr√µes de projeto.  \n- **Integra√ß√µes**: Banco de dados (MongoDB/SQL), autentica√ß√£o, APIs externas.  \n- **Front-end**: HTML sem√¢ntico, CSS avan√ßado, JavaScript puro.  \n\n---\n\n## Vamos come√ßar?  \n- **Descreva o desafio** (ex: \"Preciso criar uma API com autentica√ß√£o JWT\").  \n- **Compartilhe c√≥digo** se houver, para an√°lise detalhada.  \n- **Especifique a tecnologia** envolvida (React, Node.js, etc.).  \n\nPrecisa de ajuda com algo espec√≠fico? *Estou √† disposi√ß√£o!*"
